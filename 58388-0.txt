COLORED BRANCHES

LOUISVILLE FREE PUBLIC LIBRARY


In organizing the public library for Louisville it was planned to
have separate buildings for colored readers. The system consists of
the Main library, eight branches, 230 class room collections in 35
school buildings and 62 stations, a total of 301 centers for the
circulation of books for home use. This includes two branches, 52 class
room collections in 13 school buildings and 6 stations, a total of 60
centers for colored readers. The total circulation of books for the
year was 1,045,077. Of this number 104,771 volumes were used by colored
readers.

HISTORY. After the opening of the Main library, the colored branch came
next. It was opened on September 23, 1905 in temporary quarters in a
residence on Chestnut Street between Tenth and Eleventh. This was the
first free public library in America exclusively for colored readers
and it marked an epoch in the development of the race. At the same time
the Library Board purchased a corner lot, 69 by 120 feet, at Tenth and
Chestnut Streets. On this site was erected a Carnegie building which
was occupied: October 29, 1908.

[Illustration: Western Colored Branch]

The Western Colored Branch building is 77 feet long and 45 feet wide
and is built of brick and stone with tile roof. The building has a main
floor and basement. On the main floor near the entrance is the delivery
desk and back of it are large tables for reading and reference. To the
left on entering is a newspaper alcove, the librarian’s office and the
special room for children. To the right on entering is the magazine
alcove, a study room and the special room for adults. The basement
floor contains a large lecture room, two class rooms and supply
and boiler rooms. The building is heated throughout by hot water.
The furniture and shelving are beautiful in design and finish, and
provision is made for free access to all the books. The arrangement is
one of convenience and comfort for those who wish to read or study or
to get a book for home use.

[Illustration: Eastern Colored Branch]

The work at the first colored branch library proved so successful that
a second Carnegie building was erected in the eastern part of the
city. This is known as the Eastern Colored Branch, and was opened with
appropriate exercises January 28, 1914.

The building is well adapted for library and social center uses. It
occupies a site 75 by 150 feet at Lampton and Hancock Streets. The site
cost $5000 of which amount $1000 was raised by colored citizens. The
building is 60 by 80 feet, built of brick, concrete and stone with tile
roof, and has a main floor and basement. The first floor contains the
library room accommodating 10,000 volumes, the librarian’s office, and
an auditorium to seat 350 people. The basement has three class rooms
for club use, a playroom, 37 by 40 feet, cloak room, boiler room, etc.
An experimental garden is under cultivation in the “L” of the building
and arrangements are under way to equip a playground 60 by 75 feet in
the rear.

[Illustration: Interior Western Colored Branch]

BOOKS IN THE LIBRARIES. The libraries contain 13,655 volumes; Western
10,554, Eastern 3,101, and receive 137 current periodicals and
newspapers, all of which are for free use. New books are being added
constantly and readers are urged to make suggestions for additions
which they feel are needed and should be added to the library.

REGISTRATION. Since the opening 8,958 persons have registered as
borrowers and there are now 4,866 cards in force. This number however
does not represent all who use the libraries. There are numerous
readers daily using books at the tables and there are school room
collections which are used by the school children.

CIRCULATION. Since the opening of the libraries 595,048 volumes have
been drawn for home use. The following table of circulation by years is
interesting:

   YEAR       VOLUMES

  1905-06      17,838
  1906-07      30,419
  1907-08      35,910
  1908-09      50,386
  1909-10      58,870
  1910-11      65,175
  1911-12      73,462
  1912-13      72,222
  1913-14      85,995
  1914-15     104,771
             --------
     Total    595,048

[Illustration: Interior Eastern Colored Branch]

REFERENCE WORK. A large amount of reference work is done with the
pupils and teachers of high schools and graded schools. Since the
opening of the libraries 27,968 persons have been assisted in reference
work by the librarians. It is impossible to keep an accurate account of
the questions asked and information given.

APPRENTICE CLASS. The library conducts annually an apprentice class for
those who desire to enter library service. An examination is held in
June to enter a class which begins work in September. In preparing for
service apprentices are given three months’ work under the direction
of the branch librarian, heads of departments and chief librarian.
The course has been taken by twelve persons, four of whom came from
other cities, Houston, Evansville, Memphis and Cincinnati, preparing
for service in colored branches in these cities. Arrangements are
being made to admit three young women from other cities to take the
apprentice work with this year’s class.

EDUCATIONAL CENTER. Close co-operation with teachers is sought in work
with the schools. The libraries not only help pupils during the school
life but enable them to continue studies after leaving school.

[Illustration: Story Hour]

SOCIAL CENTER. Aside from circulating books and doing reference work,
the libraries encourage and assist in all efforts to the advancement of
our citizens to a social betterment. The people are made to feel that
the libraries belong to them and that they may be used for anything
that makes for the public welfare. During a single month forty meetings
have been held in the buildings. The following clubs and reading
circles meet regularly:

  Artisan’s Club
  Banneker Reading Circle
  Bena Mowya Club
  Big Sisters’ Committee
  Douglass Debating Club
  Douglass Glee Club
  Fisk Club
  Girls’ Club
  Girls’ Gymnastic Club
  I. K. B. Club
  Jefferson County Teachers’ Institute
  Mu-So-Lit Reading Club
  Normal Alumni
  Normal School Gymnastic Class
  Parent Teachers’ Association
  Story Hour
  Sunday School Training Class
  Wilberforce Club
  Y. W. C. A.

[Illustration: Douglass Debating Club]

MEETINGS IN THE LIBRARIES. The Story Hour is the children’s delight
and is held weekly under the direction of a trained storyteller. In
addition to the pleasure that the stories give, new experiences are
brought to the children, their imagination is enlarged and an interest
is created in books and reading. A story telling contest is held
annually and prizes are given to the children who can best reproduce a
story told during the year.

The Douglass Debating Club is composed of high school boys and meets
weekly under the direction of the branch librarian. The purpose of the
club is to acquaint its members with parliamentary usages, to keep
before them the great current questions and to train them to speak in
public. Public debates are given occasionally and a prize contest is
held annually. Following are some of the subjects debated:

  “That the right of suffrage should be extended to women.”

  “That the influence of women has contributed more to civilization
  than that of men.”

  “That the North American Indian has had greater opportunity for
  development than the Afro-American.”

  “That Lincoln was a greater American than Washington.”

  “That the United States was justified in taking up arms against
  Mexico.”

  “That Germany was justified in taking up arms against the Allies.”

  “That the United States should interfere to stop the internal strife
  in Mexico.”

of the Colored Branches:

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
