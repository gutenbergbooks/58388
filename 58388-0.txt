COLORED BRANCHES

LOUISVILLE FREE PUBLIC LIBRARY


In organizing the public library for Louisville it was planned to
have separate buildings for colored readers. The system consists of
the Main library, eight branches, 230 class room collections in 35
school buildings and 62 stations, a total of 301 centers for the
circulation of books for home use. This includes two branches, 52 class
room collections in 13 school buildings and 6 stations, a total of 60
centers for colored readers. The total circulation of books for the
year was 1,045,077. Of this number 104,771 volumes were used by colored
readers.

HISTORY. After the opening of the Main library, the colored branch came
next. It was opened on September 23, 1905 in temporary quarters in a
residence on Chestnut Street between Tenth and Eleventh. This was the
first free public library in America exclusively for colored readers
and it marked an epoch in the development of the race. At the same time
the Library Board purchased a corner lot, 69 by 120 feet, at Tenth and
Chestnut Streets. On this site was erected a Carnegie building which
was occupied: October 29, 1908.

[Illustration: Western Colored Branch]

The Western Colored Branch building is 77 feet long and 45 feet wide
and is built of brick and stone with tile roof. The building has a main
floor and basement. On the main floor near the entrance is the delivery
desk and back of it are large tables for reading and reference. To the
left on entering is a newspaper alcove, the librarian’s office and the
special room for children. To the right on entering is the magazine
alcove, a study room and the special room for adults. The basement
floor contains a large lecture room, two class rooms and supply
and boiler rooms. The building is heated throughout by hot water.
The furniture and shelving are beautiful in design and finish, and
provision is made for free access to all the books. The arrangement is
one of convenience and comfort for those who wish to read or study or
to get a book for home use.

[Illustration: Eastern Colored Branch]

The work at the first colored branch library proved so successful that
a second Carnegie building was erected in the eastern part of the
city. This is known as the Eastern Colored Branch, and was opened with
appropriate exercises January 28, 1914.

The building is well adapted for library and social center uses. It
occupies a site 75 by 150 feet at Lampton and Hancock Streets. The site
cost $5000 of which amount $1000 was raised by colored citizens. The
building is 60 by 80 feet, built of brick, concrete and stone with tile
roof, and has a main floor and basement. The first floor contains the
library room accommodating 10,000 volumes, the librarian’s office, and
an auditorium to seat 350 people. The basement has three class rooms
for club use, a playroom, 37 by 40 feet, cloak room, boiler room, etc.
An experimental garden is under cultivation in the “L” of the building
and arrangements are under way to equip a playground 60 by 75 feet in
the rear.

[Illustration: Interior Western Colored Branch]

BOOKS IN THE LIBRARIES. The libraries contain 13,655 volumes; Western
10,554, Eastern 3,101, and receive 137 current periodicals and
newspapers, all of which are for free use. New books are being added
constantly and readers are urged to make suggestions for additions
which they feel are needed and should be added to the library.

REGISTRATION. Since the opening 8,958 persons have registered as
borrowers and there are now 4,866 cards in force. This number however
does not represent all who use the libraries. There are numerous
readers daily using books at the tables and there are school room
collections which are used by the school children.

CIRCULATION. Since the opening of the libraries 595,048 volumes have
been drawn for home use. The following table of circulation by years is
interesting:

   YEAR       VOLUMES

  1905-06      17,838
  1906-07      30,419
  1907-08      35,910
  1908-09      50,386
  1909-10      58,870
  1910-11      65,175
  1911-12      73,462
  1912-13      72,222
  1913-14      85,995
  1914-15     104,771
             --------
     Total    595,048

[Illustration: Interior Eastern Colored Branch]

REFERENCE WORK. A large amount of reference work is done with the
pupils and teachers of high schools and graded schools. Since the
opening of the libraries 27,968 persons have been assisted in reference
work by the librarians. It is impossible to keep an accurate account of
the questions asked and information given.

APPRENTICE CLASS. The library conducts annually an apprentice class for
those who desire to enter library service. An examination is held in
June to enter a class which begins work in September. In preparing for
service apprentices are given three months’ work under the direction
of the branch librarian, heads of departments and chief librarian.
The course has been taken by twelve persons, four of whom came from
other cities, Houston, Evansville, Memphis and Cincinnati, preparing
for service in colored branches in these cities. Arrangements are
being made to admit three young women from other cities to take the
apprentice work with this year’s class.

EDUCATIONAL CENTER. Close co-operation with teachers is sought in work
with the schools. The libraries not only help pupils during the school
life but enable them to continue studies after leaving school.

[Illustration: Story Hour]

SOCIAL CENTER. Aside from circulating books and doing reference work,
the libraries encourage and assist in all efforts to the advancement of
our citizens to a social betterment. The people are made to feel that
the libraries belong to them and that they may be used for anything
that makes for the public welfare. During a single month forty meetings
have been held in the buildings. The following clubs and reading
circles meet regularly:

  Artisan’s Club
  Banneker Reading Circle
  Bena Mowya Club
  Big Sisters’ Committee
  Douglass Debating Club
  Douglass Glee Club
  Fisk Club
  Girls’ Club
  Girls’ Gymnastic Club
  I. K. B. Club
  Jefferson County Teachers’ Institute
  Mu-So-Lit Reading Club
  Normal Alumni
  Normal School Gymnastic Class
  Parent Teachers’ Association
  Story Hour
  Sunday School Training Class
  Wilberforce Club
  Y. W. C. A.

[Illustration: Douglass Debating Club]

MEETINGS IN THE LIBRARIES. The Story Hour is the children’s delight
and is held weekly under the direction of a trained storyteller. In
addition to the pleasure that the stories give, new experiences are
brought to the children, their imagination is enlarged and an interest
is created in books and reading. A story telling contest is held
annually and prizes are given to the children who can best reproduce a
story told during the year.

The Douglass Debating Club is composed of high school boys and meets
weekly under the direction of the branch librarian. The purpose of the
club is to acquaint its members with parliamentary usages, to keep
before them the great current questions and to train them to speak in
public. Public debates are given occasionally and a prize contest is
held annually. Following are some of the subjects debated:

  “That the right of suffrage should be extended to women.”

  “That the influence of women has contributed more to civilization
  than that of men.”

  “That the North American Indian has had greater opportunity for
  development than the Afro-American.”

  “That Lincoln was a greater American than Washington.”

  “That the United States was justified in taking up arms against
  Mexico.”

  “That Germany was justified in taking up arms against the Allies.”

  “That the United States should interfere to stop the internal strife
  in Mexico.”
