<p>In organizing the public library for Louisville it was planned
to have separate buildings for colored readers. The system
consists of the Main library, eight branches, 230 class room collections
in 35 school buildings and 62 stations, a total of 301 centers
for the circulation of books for home use. This includes two
branches, 52 class room collections in 13 school buildings and 6
stations, a total of 60 centers for colored readers. The total
circulation of books for the year was 1,045,077. Of this number
104,771 volumes were used by colored readers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">History.</span> After the opening of the Main library, the colored
branch came next. It was opened on September 23, 1905 in temporary
quarters in a residence on Chestnut Street between Tenth
and Eleventh. This was the first free public library in America
exclusively for colored readers and it marked an epoch in the
development of the race. At the same time the Library Board
purchased a corner lot, 69 by 120 feet, at Tenth and Chestnut
Streets. On this site was erected a Carnegie building which was
occupied: October 29, 1908.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_006.jpg" alt="Western Colored Branch" /></div>

<p class="caption">Western Colored Branch</p>

<p>The Western Colored Branch building is 77 feet long and 45
feet wide and is built of brick and stone with tile roof. The building
has a main floor and basement. On the main floor near the
entrance is the delivery desk and back of it are large tables for
reading and reference. To the left on entering is a newspaper
alcove, the librarian&#8217;s office and the special room for children.
To the right on entering is the magazine alcove, a study room and
the special room for adults. The basement floor contains a large
lecture room, two class rooms and supply and boiler rooms. The
building is heated throughout by hot water. The furniture and
shelving are beautiful in design and finish, and provision is made
for free access to all the books. The arrangement is one of convenience
and comfort for those who wish to read or study or to
get a book for home use.</p>

<p class="caption">Eastern Colored Branch</p>

<p>The work at the first colored branch library proved so successful
that a second Carnegie building was erected in the eastern part
of the city. This is known as the Eastern Colored Branch, and
was opened with appropriate exercises January 28, 1914.</p>

<p>The building is well adapted for library and social center
uses. It occupies a site 75 by 150 feet at Lampton and Hancock
Streets. The site cost $5000 of which amount $1000 was raised
by colored citizens. The building is 60 by 80 feet, built of brick,
concrete and stone with tile roof, and has a main floor and basement.
The first floor contains the library room accommodating
10,000 volumes, the librarian&#8217;s office, and an auditorium to seat
350 people. The basement has three class rooms for club use, a
playroom, 37 by 40 feet, cloak room, boiler room, etc. An experimental
garden is under cultivation in the &#8220;L&#8221; of the building
and arrangements are under way to equip a playground 60 by 75
feet in the rear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Books in the Libraries.</span> The libraries contain 13,655
volumes; Western 10,554, Eastern 3,101, and receive 137 current
periodicals and newspapers, all of which are for free use. New
books are being added constantly and readers are urged to make
suggestions for additions which they feel are needed and should
be added to the library.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Registration.</span> Since the opening 8,958 persons have registered
as borrowers and there are now 4,866 cards in force. This number
however does not represent all who use the libraries. There are
numerous readers daily using books at the tables and there are
school room collections which are used by the school children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Circulation.</span> Since the opening of the libraries 595,048
volumes have been drawn for home use. The following table of
circulation by years is interesting:</p>

<p class="caption">Interior Eastern Colored Branch</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reference Work.</span> A large amount of reference work is
done with the pupils and teachers of high schools and graded
schools. Since the opening of the libraries 27,968 persons have
been assisted in reference work by the librarians. It is impossible
to keep an accurate account of the questions asked and information
given.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apprentice Class.</span> The library conducts annually an apprentice
class for those who desire to enter library service. An examination
is held in June to enter a class which begins work in September.
In preparing for service apprentices are given three months&#8217;
work under the direction of the branch librarian, heads of departments
and chief librarian. The course has been taken by twelve
persons, four of whom came from other cities, Houston, Evansville,
Memphis and Cincinnati, preparing for service in colored
branches in these cities. Arrangements are being made to admit
three young women from other cities to take the apprentice work
with this year&#8217;s class.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Educational Center.</span> Close co-operation with teachers is
sought in work with the schools. The libraries not only help
pupils during the school life but enable them to continue studies
after leaving school.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_010.jpg" alt="Interior Eastern Colored Branch" /></div>

<p class="caption">Story Hour</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Social Center.</span> Aside from circulating books and doing
reference work, the libraries encourage and assist in all efforts to
the advancement of our citizens to a social betterment. The
people are made to feel that the libraries belong to them and that
they may be used for anything that makes for the public welfare.
During a single month forty meetings have been held in the buildings.
The following clubs and reading circles meet regularly:</p>

<p class="caption">Douglass Debating Club</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meetings in the Libraries.</span> The Story Hour is the children&#8217;s
delight and is held weekly under the direction of a trained storyteller.
In addition to the pleasure that the stories give, new
experiences are brought to the children, their imagination is enlarged
and an interest is created in books and reading. A story
telling contest is held annually and prizes are given to the children
who can best reproduce a story told during the year.</p>

<p>The Douglass Debating Club is composed of high school boys
and meets weekly under the direction of the branch librarian.
The purpose of the club is to acquaint its members with parliamentary
usages, to keep before them the great current questions
and to train them to speak in public. Public debates are given
occasionally and a prize contest is held annually. Following
are some of the subjects debated:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;That the right of suffrage should be extended to women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That the influence of women has contributed more to civilization
than that of men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That the North American Indian has had greater opportunity
for development than the Afro-American.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That Lincoln was a greater American than Washington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That the United States was justified in taking up arms
against Mexico.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That Germany was justified in taking up arms against the
Allies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That the United States should interfere to stop the internal
strife in Mexico.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
